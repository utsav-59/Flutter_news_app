# Flutter_news_app

* First Flutter app built to learn fundamentals through trial and error.
* Helped me understand UI structure, API integration, and basic animations.
* Simple app that calls an API and displays the response with smooth transitions.
* Served as a learning project before starting real client work.


* Code in **Development** Branch
